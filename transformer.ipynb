    "In this exercise, you will be implementing `Multi-Head Attention` to solve a toy exercise in sequence modeling. The concept of `Multi-Head Attention` is from the famous paper called [\"Attention Is All You Need\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), which introduced the Transformer model. Please read the paper carefully and answer the questions below. Understanding the concepts described in this paper will help understanding many modern models in the Neural Networks field and it's also necessary if you choose to work on the NLP project later. \n",

    "i) The biggest benefit of using Transformers instead of RNN and convolution-based models is the possibility to parallelize computations during training. Why parallelization is not possible with RNN and Convolution-based models for sequence processing, but possible with Transformers? *Note*: parallelization can be applied only to the Encoder part of the Trasnformer.

    "iii)It gives the attention layer multiple “representation subspaces”. As we’ll see next, with multi-headed attention we have not only one, but multiple sets of Query/Key/Value weight matrices (the Transformer uses eight attention heads, so we end up with eight sets for each encoder/decoder). Each of these sets is randomly initialized. Then, after training, each set is used to project the input embeddings (or vectors from lower encoders/decoders) into a different representation subspace."
